# Home page of Publishing@W3C

This is the repository for the home page of the W3C Publishing@W3C activities: [`https://www.w3.org/publishing/`](https://www.w3.org/publishing/).  
(That URL is redirected to the `w3c.github.io` view of this repository, ie [`https://w3c.github.io/publishing/`](https://w3c.github.io/publishing/).)

The repository is maintained by [mailto:ivan@w3.org](Ivan Herman); the content of the page is a joint responsibility of the W3C@Publishing staff.

How to build the site from the sources (make sure you `build` before submitting a PR):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/w3c/publishing.git
cd publishing
npm install
npm run build    # Open the pages on your brower, eg index.html
```
