Adobe has worked with both organizations to bring professional publishing techniques to the Open Web Platform and we look forward to working together to set the roadmap for the future of publishing.

Since 2015, we are promoting interoperability and accessibility via a broader use of EPUB in Europe. We believe that W3C support will encourage a broader adoption of EPUB 3, beyond the book industry, and may position EPUB as THE publishing format or any type of document. We are also confident that the work on Portable Web Publications, as initiated by W3C and IDPF experts inside the DPUB IG, associated with the work of the Readium Foundation on modern open-source reading software, will bring great benefits to readers in the coming years, including print-disabled people.",
